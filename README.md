# SSMU-Bank-reconciliation

## Welcome

This program is developed for SSMU, designed to automate their bank reconciliation process.

---

## Getting Started

1. Download the statement for the month you wish to generate from RBC Express
2. Convert the pdf to Excel. I think ilovepdf.com or smallpdf.com would work
3. Update the file_path as the path of your newly converted excel file, and report_path to where your report excel file exists
    - Make a report file, if you don't have one already.
4. Run the file! If successful, you should see 'All done! Check the excel file.' The newly generated sheet will be appended to the very end of the report workbook.
